## Design & implementation

FinTrek is a desktop app designed for university students to manage their expenses, optimized for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Architecture Overview

This diagram presents a high-level overview of the core components
that make up the FinTrek system. It illustrates how input flows
from the user to command execution, expense management, and data
persistence, with shared utilities supporting all layers.

![](images/ArchitectureOverview.png)
-------------------
Core Module Roles
-------------------

[User]
- Represents the user providing input through the CLI interface.

[Main]
- The entry point of the application.
- Initializes services and launches the UI.

[Ui]
- Interfaces directly with the user.
- Accepts user input and forwards it to the command system.
- Displays output and error messages to the user.

[CommandRegistry]
- Maintains a registry of all supported commands.
- Responsible for resolving input commands to actual Command objects.

[Command]
- Represents the logic behind each user command (e.g., add, edit, list).
- Interacts with budget, expense data and performs operations.

[CommandParser]
- Parses structured arguments (e.g., /edit 2 /d lunch /$ 10).
- Used by commands that require detailed or optional arguments.

[Expenses]
- Manages both regular and recurring expenses.
- Handles all expense-related logic and state.

[Data]
- Responsible for loading and saving expense and budget data.
- Interacts with the file system for persistence.

[Util]
- Provides shared utility functions like input validation and date handling.
- Used across multiple modules for consistency and reuse.

[Messages]
- Central repository of user-facing messages and formatting templates.
- Ensures consistent messaging across the UI and command responses.

-------------------------
High-Level Flow Summary
-------------------------

1. [Main] launches the application and starts [Ui].
2. [Ui] receives input from [User] and routes it to [CommandRegistry].
3. [CommandRegistry] locates the correct [Command] to execute.
4. If needed, [Command] invokes [CommandParser] to extract arguments.
5. [Command] operates on [Expenses] to modify data.
6. [Expenses] interacts with [Data] to persist changes.
7. Throughout the process, [Util] and [Messages] support validation
   and formatting for consistent behavior and output.

-------------------
Design Principles
-------------------

- Modular and loosely coupled design.
- Commands are pluggable and easy to extend.
- Shared utilities reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- Centralized message system ensures consistency in user output.

### Example Flow

## Command
CLASS DIAGRAM

### Adding Expenses
DESCRIPTION

![](images/add.png)

### Delete Expenses

The `/delete` command enables users to remove an expense from the expense list by specifying its index.

![](images/delete.png)

#### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

1. DeleteCommand receives the user's argument (e.g., an index to delete).

2. The command first checks for invalid or missing input:
  - Calls InputValidator.isNullOrBlank(args)
  - If the input is blank or null, an error is returned.

3. It then checks whether the input is a valid positive integer:
  - Calls InputValidator.isValidPositiveInteger(args)
  - This ensures the input is a proper index number.

4. The command calls countExpenses() to determine the total number (N)
   of current expenses:
  - This invokes ExpenseService.getLength()
  - Which forwards to RegularExpenseManager.getLength()

5. To ensure the index is within range:
  - It calls InputValidator.isInValidIntRange(args, 1, N)

6. If the index is valid, the command proceeds to delete:
  - It calls popExpense(index) on ExpenseService
  - This internally calls remove(index) on RegularExpenseManager
  - The removed Expense object is returned to the command

7. After deletion, the command may call countExpenses() again:
  - This allows it to report the new size (M) of the expense list
  - The new count is retrieved in the same way via getLength()
### List Expenses
DESCRIPTION
![](images/list.png)

### Edit Expenses
DESCRIPTION
![](images/editCommand.png)

### Summary of Expenses
DESCRIPTION

![](images/summary.png)

#### Step-by-Step Execution Flow
1. The user launches the application and adds some expenses into the application.

2. The user executes `/summary food` to view expenses for a specific category `food`.
The `execute()` method identifies the category parameter and calls `ExpenseReporter#listSingleCategoryTotal("food")`.

3. The `ExpenseReporter` filters the expenses to show only those in the category `food`,
returning a formatted summary of the category `food`.

4. If the specified category does not exist, `execute()` returns an error message.

5. Alternatively, the user executes `/summary` command to view the overall summary of the current expenses.
The `/summary` command calls `ExpenseReporter#listAllCategoryTotals()`.

6. The `ExpenseReporter` processes the expense data and returns a formatted summary containing category totals,
the highest spending category, and the grand total.

## Expense

### High-Level Responsibilities & Flow

1. [Command]
  - Represents an abstract base for all user commands.
  - Each command (e.g., AddCommand, EditCommand) interacts with
    expense-related logic via the service layer.

2. [AppServices]
  - A central factory that provides pre-instantiated shared services.
  - Holds singleton instances of:
    - ExpenseService (for data manipulation)
    - ExpenseReporter (for analytics and summaries)
  - It decouples command logic from low-level object creation.

3. [ExpenseService]
  - Provides a unified API to manipulate expenses.
  - Delegates actual data operations to the appropriate expense manager
    (either regular or recurring).

4. [ExpenseReporter]
  - Offers read-only views over expense data.
  - Used for listing, calculating totals, category summaries, etc.

5. [RecurringExpenseManager] and [RegularExpenseManager]
  - Singleton classes that manage recurring and regular expenses respectively.
  - Internally maintain a list of Expense objects.
  - Both implement the shared [ExpenseOperation] interface.

6. [ExpenseOperation] (Interface)
  - Abstracts core methods like `add`, `remove`, `get`, and `clear`.
  - Allows service and reporter classes to be reused across both
    recurring and regular modes.

7. [Expense]
  - The base model class representing a single financial transaction.
  - Stores fields like description, amount, category, and date.

### Example Flow

When a user runs a command like `/add`:

1. The AddCommand class (a subclass of Command) is executed.
2. Through AppServices, it obtains the correct ExpenseService instance.
3. ExpenseService adds the new Expense to either the
   RegularExpenseManager or RecurringExpenseManager.
4. If the user runs a query command like `/summary`,
   the command calls ExpenseReporter to aggregate data.


## Logging

`Logger.info` was used throughout the code to help the process of debugging and ensuring developers what commands or classes are called in the process.

## Input handling

All user inputs will be forced to be lowercase to be compared with the HashMap for the functions created for general and recurring expenses.

## Product scope

### CommandRouter

**Purpose**: To verify that user input is correctly interpreted and dispatched to the appropriate command.

##### Correct behavior

1. Launch the app using `FinTrek.main()`.
2. Type the following commands one at a time:

- `/add lunch $10 /c food`  
  â†’ Expected: Expense is added with category `food`. Success message is printed.

- `/list`  
  â†’ Expected: Displays a list containing the added expense.

- `/delete 1`  
  â†’ Expected: Deletes the first expense. Success message with updated count is printed.

- `/total`  
  â†’ Expected: Displays the total amount of all current expenses.

- `/average`  
  â†’ Expected: Displays the average amount of all current expenses.

- `/help add`  
  â†’ Expected: Displays detailed help message for the `/add` command.

##### Invalid command formats

Type the following commands one at a time:

- `add lunch $10`  
  â†’ Expected: Error message â€” must start with '/'.

- `/blah blah`  
  â†’ Expected: Error message â€” invalid command.

- *(Empty input or whitespace only)*  
  â†’ Expected: Error message â€” must enter a command starting with '/'.

**Note:** All errors and successful command parsing are logged using the Java `Logger`.
