## Features

## Notes about the command format:

>- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which are expected from the user,
e.g. in `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT>`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be input as `/add Food`.
>- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT> [/c<CATEGORY>] [/d<DATE>]` can be instantiated as `/add 
/Coffee $5.00 /c Beverages` or as `/add Coffee $5.00`.
>- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` or `total`) will be ignored, 
e.g. if the command specifies `help 2113`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
