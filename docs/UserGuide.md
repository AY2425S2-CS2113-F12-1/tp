# User Guide

## Introduction

**FinTrek** is a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that helps users track their personal expenses. Users can quickly add, view, analyze, and manage their expenses using short commands. It is designed for speed, simplicity, and ease of use.

---
## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have **Java 17** or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest release v2.1 `tp.jar`.
3. Run on command line using:
   `java -jar tp.jar`
---

## Features

---
> ### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes about the command format:
>- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which are expected from the user,
e.g. in `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT>`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be input as `/add Food`.
>- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT> [/c<CATEGORY>] [/d<DATE>]` can be instantiated as `/add 
/Coffee $5.00 /c Beverages` or as `/add Coffee $5.00`.
>- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `average`, or `total`) will be ignored, 
e.g. if the command specifies `list 2113`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

---
### ‚ûï Adding an Expense: `/add` or `/add-recurring`

#### General Expense

Adds a new expense to your list.

**Format**:
```
/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT> [/c <CATEGORY>] [/d <DATE>]
```

- `<AMOUNT>` must be a positive number.
- `<DATE>` must be in the format of `dd-MM-yyyy`.
-  `<CATEGORY>` will be converted to uppercase in the list of expenses.
- `/c` and `<CATEGORY>` are optional. Default is `UNCATEGORIZED`.
- `/d` and `<DATE>` are optional. Default is today's `date`

**Examples**:
```
/add Coffee $5.00 
/add Textbook $12.00 /c studies 
/add MRT $3.00 /d 04-05-2025
```
**Example Outputs**:
```
Expense added successfully: Coffee | $5.00 | UNCATEGORIZED | 05-04-2025
Expense added successfully: Textbook | $12.00 | STUDIES | 05-04-2025
Expense added successfully: MRT | $3.00 | UNCATEGORIZED | 04-05-2025
```

#### Extra: Recurring Expense

Adds a new dated recurring expense to the list, which will be added to the main list of expenses
upon startup if the date of the expense is today's date
or before today's date.

**Format**:
```
/add-recurring <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT> [/c <CATEGORY>] [/d <DATE>]
```
* The same restrictions of the input parameters for the `/add` command applies
* The recurring expense will automatically be added to the list of expenses
upon startup if
`DATE` is today's date or before today's date.
* Note that if the recurring expense is already in the list,
then no more duplicates of it will be added upon startup.

**Example**:
```
/add-recurring Coffee $5.50 /d 04-03-2025
/add-recurring Mobile Data $20.00 /c Necessities /d 05-03-2025
```

**Example Outputs**:
```
Recurring expense added successfully: Coffee | $5.50 | UNCATEGORIZED | 04-03-2025
Recurring expense added successfully: Mobile Data | $20.00 | NECESSITIES | 03-05-2025
```


#### Adding of recurring expenses upon startup
Assuming today's date is `05-04-2025`, and that the user has no budget
or other expenses yet, then upon startup, the user
can expect to see the following output:
```
Hi there, welcome to FinTrek! What can I do for you?
You have not set a monthly budget yet. Set one now!

Found some recurring expenses: 
1. Coffee | $5.50 | UNCATEGORIZED | 04-03-2025
2. Mobile Data | $20.00 | NECESSITIES | 05-03-2025

If they are due, adding them to the main list of expenses now.

This is your current list of expenses: 
1. Coffee | $5.50 | UNCATEGORIZED | 04-03-2025
2. Mobile Data | $20.00 | NECESSITIES | 05-03-2025
```

```
/edit 2 /d Dinner /$ 25.00 /c Dining /dt 25-12-2024

```angular2html
Expense at index 2 updated successfully:

```

#### Extra: Recurring Expenses
**Format**:
```
/edit-recurring <INDEX> [/d <DESCRIPTION>] [/$ <AMOUNT>] [/c <CATEGORY>] [/dt <DATE>]

**Example**:
```
/edit-recurring 2 /d Dinner /$ 25.00

### ‚úÖ Saving the data
FinTrek saves data of your expenses automatically in the hard disk
using a save file called `data.txt`. There is no need to save manually.

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Editing the data file
FinTrek data are saved automatically inside a local `data.txt` file.
Advanced users who know what they are doing are welcome to update
their list of expenses directly by editing the txt file.

> #### ‚ùóCAUTION
> - If your changes to one of the lines in the data file makes its format invalid, that line will be skipped
>by FinTrek, and it will notify you on the Command Line.
> - Hence, that particular expense will not be included in your list of expenses.
> - Only update the data directly by editing the data file if you are
> confident that you are making the right changes, following the 
> correct format.
> - Do not delete the save file while FinTrek is running! Doing so
will cause any budget or expense updates you did in the session to not be saved,
and might even cause an unexpected behaviour.


## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Install the app in another computer and simply overwrite the empty `data.txt` save file
it creates with the `data.txt`save file that contains all your previous data.

**Q**: Can I use this app in other languages?

**A**: Currently, FinTrek only supports the English language.
Inputting foreign characters to command arguments might therefore cause
unexpected behaviour.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection to use this app?

**A**: Nope! FinTrek is readily available to use offline.
