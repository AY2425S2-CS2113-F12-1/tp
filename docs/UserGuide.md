# User Guide

## Introduction

**FinTrek** is a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that helps users track their personal expenses. Users can quickly add, view, analyze, and manage their expenses using short commands. It is designed for speed, simplicity, and ease of use.

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have **Java 17** or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest release v2.1 `tp.jar`.
3. Run on command line using:
   `java -jar tp.jar`
---

## Features

## Notes about the command format:

>- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which are expected from the user,
e.g. in `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT>`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be input as `/add Food`.
>- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `/add <DESCRIPTION> $<AMOUNT> [/c<CATEGORY>] [/d<DATE>]` can be instantiated as `/add 
/Coffee $5.00 /c Beverages` or as `/add Coffee $5.00`.
>- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` or `total`) will be ignored, 
e.g. if the command specifies `list 2113`, it will be interpreted as `list`.


### ‚ûï Adding an Expense: `/add` or `/add-recurring`
