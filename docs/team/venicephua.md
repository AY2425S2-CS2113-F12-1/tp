## Overview
FinTrek is a CLI-based desktop application, designed to allow users to track and manage their 
expenses efficiently. Users can conveniently record and analyze their expenses with FinTrek.

### Summary of Contributions
- New Feature: Added Summary command that allows users to view a brief summary of their expenses.
  - What it does: displays either the overall summary of expenses with all categories, or the summary of one specific category and the expenses in it. 
  - Justification: This feature allows users to monitor and draw conclusions about their spending patterns, allowing them to better manage their expenditure and keep within their budget.
  - Highlights: This feature was interesting to implement as I used HashMap to group the expenses by categories, instead of working with List which was used to manage the expenses.
- New Feature: Added Total command to display grand total of expenditure.
- JUnit Tests: Designed tests for `Help`, `List`, `Summary`, and `Total` commands
