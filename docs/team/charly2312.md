## Credits
1. My team F12-1 for being very productive, communicative and diligent in debugging and creating documentation
2. ChatGPT to help understand regex pattern
3. Teaching Assistant, Lee Jun Hao Bryan, on giving suggestions on how to move forward and what to improve on for TP and IP

## Overview
* Created a function to list out all commands with respective formats
* Improved the code by creating and integrating codes for recurring expense
by applying OOP concept of abstraction and inheritance 
* Performed JUnit Tests for recurring expenses functions such as
adding them automatically to the general expense list, 
adding a recurring and deleting a recurring expense
  * This function was refactored by my team to make it more efficient and robust
* Created UML diagrams and outline of the developer guide
  * Diagrams include `Command` (abstract) class diagram and `Total` command sequential diagram
  * Create `/budget-edit` sequential diagram
* Maintaining the CI checks by refactoring or adjusting codes in the unit tests.

#### Enhancements implemented:

1. Implement recurring expenses function such as adding and deleting
2. Implement the check of recurring expenses' dates to see if they should be added to the regular expense list
3. Implement `/budget-left` to show to the user the current monthly budget, total expenses and

#### Contributions to UG:
1. Updating command summary
2. Updating commands to include recurring expenses and new features 
   * Some examples are `/budget-left` `add-category`
