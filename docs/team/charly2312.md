# Charly Chandra - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
* Created a function to list out all commands with respective formats
* Improved the code by creating and integrating codes for recurring expense
by applying OOP concept of abstraction and inheritance 
* Performed JUnit Tests for recurring expenses functions such as
adding them automatically to the general expense list, 
adding a recurring and deleting a recurring expense
  * This function was refactored by my team to make it more efficient and robust
* Created UML diagrams and outline of the developer guide
  * Diagrams include `Command` (abstract) class diagram and `Total` command sequential diaggram
* Maintaining the CI checks by refactoring or adjusting codes in the unit tests.
